{~p} ∧ q ∨ r ⊕ s ↓ [a ⊙ ~b] → c (simplify_logic is so hellbent on POS or SOP form that the output is horribly long)
p & q ∧ r & s
t ↑ r | q ⊼ p
r → q ⇒ p ⊃ o
~¬¬¬¬!!~p (should give p)

p ∨ q ∥ r + s ↓ t ⊽ u ⊕ v ⊻ w ↮ x ⊙ y
a & c ∨ ~[~b & (T & d ∨ ~{~b & a})] (should give the DNF expression b | (a & c) | (a & ~d). [(d -> c) & a] -> b when reducing operators)
⊤ ↑ ⊥ | ⊥ ⊼ ⊥ (should give ⊤)
~p ∨ q (should give p → q)
